/**
 * Static SEO generator.
 *
 * The data app is a single-page application that fetches from the publishers
 * directly, which is what keeps the privacy and legal posture intact — the only
 * server-side component is the optional Muse AI proxy under `functions/api/muse/`,
 * and housing data never passes through it. But search engines cannot execute
 * JavaScript reliably, and a user with JavaScript disabled gets nothing. So the
 * discoverable surface is generated ahead of time from public data, at build
 * time, and served as static files.
 *
 * Sizing, measured rather than guessed: TIGERweb reports 33,791 ZCTAs. Cloudflare
 * Pages enforces a hard limit of 20,000 files per deployment, so a page per ZIP
 * is not merely inelegant, it does not deploy. That limit is what shapes this
 * design:
 *
 *   - the full crawlable index goes in `sitemap.xml`, covering every ZCTA, at
 *     the cost of one file;
 *   - static pages are generated only for the areas people actually search for
 *     in practice — a curated set of metropolitan areas and their ZIPs — which
 *     stays well inside the deployment limit;
 *   - everything else remains reachable through the live app, which is the
 *     authoritative view anyway.
 *
 * The figures are deliberately NOT baked in. They change annually, they require
 * a Census key, and embedding a stale number in a search snippet is exactly the
 * kind of confidently-wrong output this project exists to avoid. The static page
 * is an entry point into the live, auditable view.
 *
 * The list is fetched at build time from a keyless source, so the generator
 * runs in CI with no credentials.

 * a real file at the root. Files in a `seo/` subdirectory are therefore
 * unreachable: `/sitemap.xml` falls through to the shell and returns index.html,

  This page does not pre-render the figures themselves. Data is fetched live
  from the Census Bureau in your browser so that what you read is current and
