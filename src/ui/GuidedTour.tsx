/**
 * What this is, and why it asks for a key.
 *
 * The application holds no data. Every figure is fetched from its publisher by the
 * visitor's own browser at the moment they ask for it, which is what makes the
 * privacy claim in `docs/governance.md` true rather than aspirational. The cost of
 * that choice is that the country-wide screen needs a free Census key before it
 * will load, and a first-time visitor meets a request before they meet any data.
 *
 * So this says so plainly, once, and then gets out of the way.
 *
 * Three implementation decisions worth stating:
 *
 * **Nothing modal appears uninvited.** The first version opened a `<dialog
 * showModal()>` on arrival. Testing found it blocked the search box — the one
 * control that works without a Census key — on every first visit, and made 22
 * browser tests fail because they could not type into it. A modal that covers the
 * primary action on the first screen is a dark pattern regardless of how easy it
 * is to dismiss, because the reader has not yet learned that dismissing is an
 * option. So first visit now gets a non-modal notice inline, and the dialog opens
 * only when asked for.
 *
 * **A native `<dialog>` with `showModal()`, not a custom modal.** Once it is asked
 * for, the browser supplies the focus trap, the initial focus placement, Escape
 * handling, and the inertness of the page behind it. All four are exactly the
 * things a hand-rolled modal gets subtly wrong, and each is a keyboard trap when
 * it does.
 *
 * **It never reappears uninvited.** Dismissal is recorded, and a permanent button
 * reopens it. A tour that keeps interrupting someone who has already read it is
 * worse than no tour, because it teaches people to dismiss dialogs without
 * reading them — which then costs us the reader who needed it.
 *
 * **The copy states the limit rather than hiding it.** This says the key is free,
 * says where it is stored, says the project never sees it, and says plainly that
 * single-area lookup works without one. A tour that oversold what is available
 * behind the key would make the actual experience worse than arriving with no
 * expectations at all.
