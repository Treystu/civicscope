          How CivicScope works

        <div className="mt-2 space-y-3 text-sm leading-relaxed text-slate-700">
          <p>
            CivicScope fetches data directly from its publishers in your browser. There is no server between you
            and the source, no database of our own, and no record of what you searched for. That is a technical
            decision with a purpose: an operator that cannot see who searched where cannot deliver different
            results to different people.
          </p>
          <p>
            We show three things for every figure: the value, its margin of error where the publisher supplies
            one, and the exact dataset, table, and query it came from. If a number here is wrong, you can fetch
            the original and check.
          </p>
          <p>
            The affordability index is a limited summary of selected housing-cost figures, not an objective
            verdict on a place. Its inputs, weights, and exclusions are published, and the underlying figures
            remain available beside it.

            This site is deployed with the project&rsquo;s own shared Census application key, so the full dataset

          Three things are true and worth stating plainly rather than glossing. The repository sits in a GitHub
          organisation, which is an organisation that can delete it, so it is not unowned in the strict sense.
          Donations are possible, but they go to a person&rsquo;s accounts rather than to a collective, so the
          money is personal property and the balance is not public. And nothing here is funded, so nothing here
          is guaranteed &mdash; a source can change and the maintainer can stop.

          What survives all of that is the part that matters for your trust in a number: every figure here is
