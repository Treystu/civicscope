/**
 * Versioned sweep cache.
 *
 * This is separate from the generic HTTP cache because the sweep has different
 * needs: many medium-sized records that arrive incrementally, must be readable
 * while more are still arriving, and must be invalidated wholesale when the
 * variable set or the data vintage changes.
 *
 * Three properties matter:
 *
 *   1. A version stamp. `acs5:2023:screen:v1` is the key prefix. Change the
 *      vintage or the variable set and the bump invalidates every chunk at
 *      once, so stale numbers can never be shown under a current label.
 *   2. Independent chunks. A failed or skipped chunk leaves a valid partial
 *      result rather than corrupting the whole record.
 *   3. Stale-while-revalidate. Cached data renders immediately and refresh
 *      happens in the background, so a visitor is never blocked on the network
 *      and an expired entry is still better than a blank page.
 *
 * Storage is IndexedDB with an in-memory fallback, because a browser in private
 * mode or with storage disabled must still work, just without persistence.
