/**
 * Geocoding.
 *
 * Design note, learned the hard way.
 *
 * The original implementation geocoded through Photon, a public OSM service.
 * A 370-ZIP audit exhausted its request budget and it refused connections
 * afterwards. Because rate limits are per-IP, that failure mode applies to every
 * visitor of the deployed site too, not just to the build machine. A free
 * public geocoder is not a safe dependency for a public utility.
 *
 * The replacement is the US Census Bureau's own TIGERweb service, which:
 *   - resolves a ZIP Code Tabulation Area to a point directly, with no
 *     third-party index and no ambiguity about country;
 *   - is a government service that does not rate-limit consumers the way a
 *     hobby-run OSM instance does;
 *   - sends Access-Control-Allow-Origin, so it works from the browser;
 *   - needs no key.
 *
 * TIGERweb is also already a dependency for tract and school-district
 * boundaries, so this removes a third-party dependency rather than adding one.
 *
 * Photon is retained only as a fallback for free-text place names that are not
 * ZIP codes, and it is never asked a question the Census service answers.
