/**
 * Which city a ZIP code is in, from a committed Census artefact.
 *
 * The app could ask before it answered. It does not, for two reasons that were
 * measured rather than assumed.
 *
 * The first is cost: a country-wide screening table has 33,791 rows, and a geocode
 * per row would be 33,791 requests against a daily allowance of 450. The mapping
 * is baked instead, served from `/map/` under an immutable year-long header, so
 * it costs one request the first time and nothing thereafter.
 *
 * The second is the one that decided it. `geocode.ts` records that a 370-ZIP
 * audit exhausted a public OSM geocoder's budget and that it then refused
 * connections — and because the limits are per-IP, that failure would apply to
 * every visitor of the deployed site, not just to the build machine. A city
 * search that asks a third party on every keystroke is the same mistake at a
 * higher request rate. It also contradicts the claim `docs/governance.md` rests
 * on, that nobody can see who searched for what.
 *
 * Names are stored exactly as the Census Bureau publishes them and are shortened
 * for display here rather than in the generator. Two reasons: a mapping that is
 * subtly wrong is worse than none, because it looks right; and the published name
 * is auditable against the source file by string comparison.
